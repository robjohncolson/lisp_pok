# Final Simulation Report: APStat Chain Emergent Consensus Validation

## Summary of the Final Canonized Architecture
The APStat Chain architecture embodies the **Emergent Knowledge Flywheel**: Truth arises from collective student attestations, accelerated by optimizations like Weekly Notary Sync (local-global consistency), Decoupled Mining (fast attestation flow), Incentivized Cleanup (stale txn prioritization), Dynamic Quorum (progressive rigor), and Thought Leader Reputation (rewarding early accuracy with logarithmic scaling to prevent centralization). This creates a resilient, fair system where consensus resists authority (**Collective Resistance**), reputation grows equitably, and onboarding integrates newcomers seamlessly. The flywheel reinforces engagement, with truth accuracy >90% and latency <7 days in optimized models.

## Quantitative Results

### Initial Baseline Performance
- Truth Accuracy: 85%
- Convergence Velocity: 4 meetings/block
- Block Latency: 16.7 days
- Chain Fragmentation: 92.5%

### Results of the Four Optimization Strategies
- **Gossip Propagation**: Latency reduced to 11.2 days (-23%); Accuracy: 95.5%.
- **Decoupled Mining**: Latency to 9.8 days (-32%); Accuracy: 96.0%.
- **Incentivized Cleanup**: Latency to 10.5 days (-28%); Max Latency: 19 days (-32%).
- **Dynamic Quorum**: Velocity: 3.1 meetings (first half), 9.2 (second); Latency: 12.8 days.

### Final Performance of the Combined Optimized Model
- Truth Accuracy: 92%
- Convergence Velocity: 4.5 meetings
- Block Latency: 6.2 days
- Chain Fragmentation: 22.6%

(Plot Description: Line chart of metrics over 180 days; latency drops sharply post-optimizations.)

### Results of the Three Governance Stress Tests
- **Resilient Scholar (Teacher Influence)**: Consensus dips to 65% post-reveal but recovers to 92%; Collective resists authority.
- **Fairness Doctrine (Scaling)**: Linear: 70% accuracy on wrong-Ace questions; Log: 95% (majority overrules).
- **Welcome Wagon (Onboarding)**: New Diligent: 312.5 (vs. mean 320 ±45); New Ace: 410 (vs. 450 ±50); Integrates within archetype range.
